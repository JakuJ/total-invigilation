# This page knows you're looking away
This is a collection of some [simple ways](index.js) to detect when the user is inactive or leaves the page.
All of them use internal browser APIs and thus require only vanilla JS to work.

This is just a quick proof of concept, but something more advanced could be integrated into a platform for online tests or exams.
